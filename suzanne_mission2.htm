      <img src="mission05.jpg" align="left" height="350" width="224">My next area
was Belgrano which I was only in for two weeks when my companion and I
switched areas with some elders.&nbsp; Luckily we didn't have to move to
a different apartment.
      <p>Urquiza was next.&nbsp; On our preparation days we loved to play volleyball.&nbsp;
In fact we loved it so much that we actually climbed over the fence you
see in the<img src="mission06.jpg" align="right" height="350" width="214"> picture.&nbsp;
Someone forgot the key, but that didn't stop us.&nbsp; Buenos Aires can
get some amazing storms.&nbsp; I loved the electrical storms the best.&nbsp;
We frequently were surprised with showers as you can see by my next photo.&nbsp;
The people of Argentina love their Mate (pronounced MAH-tay).&nbsp; It is a type of herb tea
that is drunk by all.&nbsp; It is a similar event as the english tea time,
but it happens at any time of day and can happen more than once.&nbsp;
They used it as a way to socialize with one another.&nbsp; Below is a member
sipping mate from a grapefruit instead of the usual cup called a bombilla.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My companions in this area were Hna. Weinman of Texas, Hna. Marchi of Corrientes,
Argentina and Hna. Martinelli of Cordoba, Argentina.&nbsp; I was there
for&nbsp; 4 1/2 months.
