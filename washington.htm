      <div align="left"><big><big><small><small><i>After
months of planning a summer vacation to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/glac/">Glacier National Park in
Montana</a>, we found ourselves just a couple of days away
needing to change plans. &nbsp;With all of the lightning-induced <a href="http://geomac.usgs.gov/viewer/viewer.htm">fires</a>
that have plagued Idaho and Montana this summer, we took one last look
at the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/glac/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm">webcams</a>
in the park, and decided that it just wasn't going to be an enjoyable
trip with all of the smoke up there.<br>
      <br>
We weren't too terribly disappointed, however. &nbsp;Now that we
live in the Northwest, there are oodles of places we want to go
explore. &nbsp;On a whim, we chose Washington state.
&nbsp;Suzanne and the kids had never been to Washington before, and
since it is the Evergreen State, it wasn't suffering from the smoke as
bad.<br>
      <br>
In ten days, we explored <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/">Mount
St. Helens National Volcanic Monument</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nps.gov/mora/">Mount Rainier National Park</a>,
      <a href="http://www.nps.gov/olym/">Olympic National
Park</a>, and <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/">Seattle</a>.
&nbsp;We put 2020 miles on the car, and 39.7 miles on our feet.
&nbsp;At that, there was still more that we could've explored had
there been more time to do so. &nbsp;Below is a route of our trip.<br>

      <h3>Lowlights</h3>
      <i>We were actually favored with excellent weather
conditions for
the most part. &nbsp;While the Olympic Peninsula is the wettest
place
in the contiguous 48 states, there was just a little bit of rain while
we were driving to our campground, but by the time we arrived, the
skies were opening up. &nbsp;We spent almost three days there, and
never got a drop of rain on us! &nbsp;In fact, we spent almost all
of
our time west of the Cascades, and we only got a little drizzle of
moisture on our first day. &nbsp;Also, there were very few bugs and
mosquitos to deal with. &nbsp;Otherwise, we were favored with sunny
skies and idyllic temperatures. &nbsp;Even so, there were a few
things
that could've gone better. &nbsp;Here is a small list of complaints:</i>
      <ul>
        <li>Not enough time to see everything!</li>
        <li>Mount Saint Helens gave us just a peek of a view
through the clouds</li>
        <li>Mount Rainier spent most of the time in the clouds</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Takeaways</h3>
      <i>Here are a few final thoughts from our vacation:</i><br>
      <ul>
        <li><u><b>Washington truly is the Evergreen
state</b></u>. &nbsp;We drove for days and days and
days, and it seemed like we were in one giant forest the whole time.
&nbsp;Even the Seattle area is loaded with trees on every square
inch of land that hasn't already been developed.</li>
        <li><u><b>Washington has a lot of water</b></u>.
&nbsp;We lost count of the number of waterfalls that we saw, but
I'm sure it was probably somewhere around twenty! &nbsp;Of course,
this shouldn't have surprised us... to be the Evergreen State, you need
lots of water. &nbsp;We found it very difficult to pick a favorite waterfall... each one has its own special charm. &nbsp;</li>
        <li><u><b>There is a lot of fun stuff to do
in Seattle</b></u>. &nbsp;We only gave ourselves one
day in our itenerary,&nbsp; ended up spending two days, and then
wished we would've had three! &nbsp;Our city-boy, Raymond, was
really disappointed to leave!</li>
        <li><u><b>The beach is a great place for a
meteor shower</b></u>... especially if it's at the peak of
the best meteor shower of the year, which this year happened to
coincide with a new moon! &nbsp;We could see gobs of stars, and a
great assortment of meteors.</li>
        <li><u><b>Olympic National Park is huge</b></u>! &nbsp;It is
very difficult to access this park, but it is well worth the effort.
&nbsp;95% is designated as wilderness area, so we just got to see the
highlights from the road, and that took us nearly three days.
&nbsp;Olympic protects 75 miles of pristine Washington coastline, and
only a few small points are accessible by car... And the rest? &nbsp;By
backpack and foot only! &nbsp;The range is simply spectacular, and both
Mike and Suzanne agreed that we felt like breaking out in singing "The
Sound of Music" for their majestic Alps-like appearance.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Photos</h3>
      <i>As you've come to expect from the Lewis Family, there are
loads of pictures to wade through from our vacation. &nbsp;We've
uploaded the following five albums 
consisting of over 300 pictures! &nbsp;
