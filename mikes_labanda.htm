      <p><i>La Banda del R&iacute;o Sal&iacute; was my second and only area in
the province of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucum%C3%A1n">Tucum&aacute;n</a>.&nbsp;
I consider this area to be the pivotal area of my mission.&nbsp; It was
the most instructive, most faith-promoting, and most productive areas of
my mission.&nbsp; As a result, you'll notice that I've included more photos
on this page than any other mission page.</i>

1990, Italy was host to the largest sporting event for the world's most
popular sport--soccer, or f&uacute;tbol, in Spanish.&nbsp; That year, Argentina
overcame a first-game loss to first-time World Cup participant, Cameroon
in a most humiliating defeat.&nbsp; Down, but not out, Argentina would
stage a comeback that would propel them into the final match with another
two-time World Cup winner, Germany.&nbsp; This picture demonstrates the
enthusiasm of the Argentine people just moments after Argentina eliminated
host Italy in a dramatic, penalty-kick overtime, semi-final match.&nbsp;
To this day, I enjoy watching the four-year tournament more than any other
sporting event.</td>

Banda del R&iacute;o Sal&iacute; was one of the most memorable areas of
my mission.&nbsp; One reason was because I was there longer than any other
area--6 months to be precise.&nbsp; Another reason is because my companions
and I had great success teaching the gospel to the people of La Banda.&nbsp;
The main reason, however, were the great members of the branch in that
area, some of which are pictured here.</td>

sugar harvest, these <i>ingenios, </i>or sugar cane factories, spewed out
smoke and ash in amazing quantities.&nbsp; We missionaries always kept
eye drops on hand to rinse out the black ash that would gather in our eyelids
while riding our bicycles around the area.&nbsp; Sometimes, to appear presentable,
we would change our ash-soiled white shirts twice a day.</td>
