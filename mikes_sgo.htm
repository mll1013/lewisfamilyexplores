      <p><i>My mission consisted of the four most northwestern provinces in Argentina--namely,
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujuy_Province">Jujuy</a>,
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salta_Province">Salta</a>,
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucum%C3%A1n_Province">Tucuman</a>,
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_del_Estero_Province">Santiago
del Estero</a>.&nbsp; By my fouth area, I had been in all four of them.&nbsp;
This was my only area in a provincial capital, and it was nice to have
all of the conveniences and commodities of a populated city.&nbsp; In fact,
this was one of the few areas where fresh milk was available.&nbsp; In
nearly every other area, it was powedered milk or no milk at all!</i>

trying to stay dry in Santiago.&nbsp; In the heart of downtown, our apartment
was only a block away from this frequently flooded intersection.&nbsp;
During the summer months, it would rain many evenings, but the scorching
sun would dry it all up the next day.&nbsp; The humidity was such that
you could literally feel the evaporated moisture lifting up from the sidewalks.</td>

to the cementary in the poorer <a href="mikes_jvg.htm">Joaquin V. Gonzalez</a>,
this cemetary is much nicer.&nbsp; Similar to both, however, is that the
"burial" of individuals happens above ground.&nbsp; The buildings you see
here contain caskets and urns.&nbsp; In some cases, the buildings are accessible
such that you can walk in and see the caskets and urns in open view.&nbsp;
Occasionally, you'll even see a bone errantly located outside of the casket
visible to all who enter.&nbsp; As you can imagine it feels rather erie
to walk into one of these edifices.</td>
