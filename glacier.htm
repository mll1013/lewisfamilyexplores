      <div align="center"><big><big><b>Glacier
National Park<br>
      </b></big></big>
      <div align="left"><big><big><small><small><i>"Third
time's a charm!" That's exactly how many times it took us to get to <a
 href="http://www.nps.gov/glac/">Glacier National Park in
Montana</a>, and it was more than worth the wait. &nbsp;When
we first tried to visit the park last August, we found ourselves just a
couple of days away
from Glacier, needing to change plans. &nbsp;With all of the
lightning-induced <a href="http://geomac.usgs.gov/viewer/viewer.htm">fires</a>
that had plagued Idaho and Montana last summer, we took one last look
at the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/glac/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm">webcams</a>
in the park, and decided that it just wasn't going to be an enjoyable
trip with all of the smoke up there.<br>
      <br>
No problem... we'll just go in June next time to beat fire season,
right? &nbsp;Wrong! &nbsp;By the end of June, the <a
 href="http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/goingtothesunroad.htm">Going-to-the-Sun
(GTTS) Road</a> was still closed due to snow. &nbsp;Wow!
&nbsp;What a difficult park to visit, and what a narrow window of
opportunity between snow and fire. &nbsp;So, we waited out one more
month of the summer, and finally made it!<br>
      <br>
In ten days, we put 1500 miles on the car: 500 to get to the park, 500
driving around there, and 500 to get back.&nbsp; Even so, Glacier
may be one of the least-geared National Park's for driving.
&nbsp;The GTTS disects the park going east-to-west, but to really
see the park, you need to get out on the trails. &nbsp;The park has
about 100 miles of well-travelled roadways, and about 700 miles of
trails. &nbsp;That's why we ended up hiking nearly 40 miles, with a
total elevation gain of over 5400 feet. &nbsp;Total climb distance
(all
of the ups between the low and high elevation of each hike) was around
9000 feet! &nbsp;No wonder the kids were complaining by the time we
were done! &nbsp;Amelia and Raymond were real troopers both on the
trail and in the car... particularly during that 13-hour dash home.<br>

      <big><big><small><small><i><i>It's
hard to complain about the
beauty of Glacier, or how well the vacation went in general, but here
is a small list of complaints:</i> </i></small></small></big></big>
      <ul>
        <li><big><big><small><small><i>Even
with 6 lodging
establishments and over 1000 campsites, the campgrounds are packed!
&nbsp;You gotta act fast if you want to get a campsite.</i></small></small></big></big></li>
        <li><big><big><small><small><i>Campsites
can be a bit tight at
many of the campgrounds. &nbsp;We had a hard time finding good
campsites that would accomodate our tent.<br>
          </i></small></small></big></big></li>
        <li><big><big><small><small><i>We
wanted the weather to cooperate with us 100% of the time... but we
happily settled for 90%.</i></small></small></big></big></li>
        <li><big><big><small><small><i>Not
that we didn't expect it, but the insects can be pretty annoying--not
to mention tenacious!</i></small></small></big></big></li>
        <li><big><big><small><small><i>This
is one very busy park. &nbsp;We found very
few opportunities to be away from massive crowds, even though this park
is very far away from any major population. &nbsp;We did find that
Waterton
Lakes National Park... Glacier's partner in Canada, was much less
visited, but still highly enjoyable.</i></small></small></big></big></li>

      <h3><big><big><small><small><i>Takeaways</i></small></small></big></big></h3>
      <big><big><small><small><i><i>Here
are a few final thoughts from our vacation:</i><br>
      </i></small></small></big></big>
      <ul>
        <li><big><big><small><small><i><u><b>Wildlife</b></u>.
&nbsp;Glacier National Park is truly wild! &nbsp;No wonder they
beat it
into car campers to put EVERYTHING away that could potentially attract
bears into the campgrounds. &nbsp;We saw <b>deer</b>, <b>elk</b>, <b>moose</b>,
          <b>bear</b><b></b>, <b>bighorn sheep</b>, and even the cute <b>hoary
marmot</b>. &nbsp;</i></small></small></big></big></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><big><big><small><small><i>We thought we were totally
fulfilled after seeing the juvenile grizzly that bounded across the
road in front of our car in Canada, but when we saw a full-sized <font
 color="#ff0000"><b>grizzly bear</b></font> come directly at us out of
the brush about 30 yards away from our trail... well, that
gave us quite a start! &nbsp;Needless to say, we got ourselves as
quietly as possible up the path before snapping a couple of quick
pictures and moving on.</i></small></small></big></big></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><big><big><small><small><i>We'd
just learned the night before about the mischeivous <font
 color="#ff0000"><b>marmot</b>,</font>
so when we saw the little rodent sneaking around the shuttle boat
shelter where unsuspecting park visitors left there belongings while
waiting on the shore of the lake, we knew exactly what he was up to.
&nbsp;No sooner could we alert the group of people about the
marmot's
presence, we turn to see the guy quickly hauling off his prey--the
defenseless sweatshirt never knew what hit it. &nbsp;Being closest
to
the critter, I bolted after him and was able to pluck it from him
before he disappeared around the corner and restored it to its proper
owner, who couldn't help laugh at the antics of the overstuffed
squirrel.</i></small></small></big></big></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><big><big><small><small><i>Walking
back from Red Rock
Falls, we noticed a couple approaching us from down the trail.
&nbsp;Compleletly unaware, we noticed a large object move across
the
trail behind them. &nbsp;Through the trees, there was no mistaking
the
distinct profile of a female <font color="#ff0000"><b>moose</b></font>,
right where another trail went off to Fishercap Lake. &nbsp;We
slowly
and quietly wandered down the path, but never again saw the moose until
we got to the shore of the lake, where a crowd of awe-struck spectators
where already starting to watch the moose amble out into the shallow
lake for some feeding. &nbsp;Across the lake, we could hear at
least
one more moose groan under the protection of a thicket of trees.</i></small></small></big></big></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <big><big><small><small><i></i></small></small></big></big>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><big><big><small><small><i>The <font color="#ff0000"><b>bighorn
sheep</b></font>
was a ewe that we saw right in the parking area of the Many Glacier
Hotel. &nbsp;She was just grazing there right beside our car as we
drove by. &nbsp;In fact, we had to proceed carefully, because she was
right in the road for a moment and we weren't sure that she was going
to stay out of the way. &nbsp;Animals have little fear of people when
they are protected by National Park status.<br>
            </i></small></small></big></big></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><big><big><small><small><i><u><b>Breath-taking
scenery</b></u>.
&nbsp;We don't expect our pictures will do much justice to the
magnificience of the scenery. &nbsp;Rushing creeks, pounding
waterfalls, massive glaciated valleys, gorgeous hanging valleys, rocks
of every color, steep and jagged mountains, and turquoise-colored lakes
kept our jaws dropped for the entire trip. &nbsp;In fact, in many
settings, we couldn't get the scene in one picture, so we took nearly
30 panoramics and stitched them together afterwards with <a
 href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">hugin</a>.</i></small></small></big></big></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><big><big><small><small><i><u><b>Weather</b></u>.
&nbsp;From hazy to crystal clear; still air, to gusty wind; rain,
hail
and abundant sunshine. &nbsp;Expect everything when you're in
glacier... &nbsp;As they say, "if you don't like the weather, just
wait." &nbsp;We were blessed with mostly excellent weather, but
never
did get to see Logan Pass on the Continental Divide with any sunlight
on it.</i></small></small></big></big></li>
      </ul>
      <h3><big><big><small><small><i>Photos</i></small></small></big></big></h3>
      <big><big><small><small><i><i>As
you've come to expect from the Lewis Family, there
are
loads of pictures to wade through from our vacation. &nbsp;We found
so
many panoramic scenes, that we snapped more pans on this trip than any
other. &nbsp;Thank goodness for <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">hugin</a>,
