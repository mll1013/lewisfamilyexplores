<span style="font-style: italic;">Along with three other
adult leaders, we took&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scouting.org/">BSA</a> unit 655 on a snowshoe trip to <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/kelcema-lake-snowshoe">Kelcema
Lake</a> along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Loop_Highway">Mountain Loop Highway</a>. &nbsp;With the exception of a
couple of young men, very few of the twelve boys who came along had
ever snowshoed before. &nbsp;We had a great day enjoying the
beautiful scenery, even though it was a more rigiorous adventure than
most were expecting. &nbsp;Originally, we had planned on hiking to
the <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/big-four-ice-caves-snowshoe">Big Four Ice Caves</a>, which would have been an easier itinerary, but
that hike was closed due to avalanche danger, so rather than hike along
the road which didn't really need any snowshoes at all, we decided to
hike along <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/NF-4052,+Granite+Falls,+WA+98252/@48.1006514,-121.5863394,14z/data=%214m5%213m4%211s0x549ace96e5b1bff3:0xa13066ed1bac85ce%218m2%213d48.1037901%214d-121.5662106">Deer Creek Road (NF-1042)</a>. &nbsp;With 1700 feet of&nbsp;
elevation&nbsp;gain, we definitely found enough snow to strap on
the showshoes. &nbsp;The 10 mile round-trip hike took six hours to
complete, but it didn't feel that long (although some of the
scouts might debate that.) &nbsp;<br>
<br>
When we started out, I told our scouts that we had 4.5 miles to reach
the lake, but that we would hike for 2.5 hours and then turn around if
we couldn't make it all the way in that period of time. &nbsp;We were at the 2.5
hour mark when the entire group had caught up to an icicle-laden rock
wall that the boys were having fun with. &nbsp;I told them that we
still had about a mile to get to the lake, and that we could turn back
as promised. &nbsp;I asked who wanted to continue on to the lake,
and nearly every one of them pressed forward! &nbsp;I was proud of
these young men for their determination to press on to their final goal
even though it was hard work.<br><br>Photos of the boys and the scenery are posted online <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/albums/72157680940180596">here</a>. <br>
