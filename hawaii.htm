      <p>Mike and I were fortunate to be given a honeymoon trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Hawaii</a>
by his parents.&nbsp; The island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu">Oahu</a>
is beautiful, but also very crowded.&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Head_%28Hawaii%29">Diamond
Head</a> is the most promonate landmark on the island.&nbsp; It is the
remains of an ancient volcano.&nbsp; One of our favorite things that we
did was snorkeling at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanauma_Bay">Hanauma
Bay</a>.&nbsp; It was amazing to swim that close to the fish and to have
such clear water.&nbsp; The warm 80 degree water
made it feel more like a bath than the ocean.&nbsp; Another highlight was
our visit to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor">Pearl
Harbor Memorial</a>.&nbsp; It was especially important to Mike since his
Grandfather had been stationed on a ship there at the time of the attack.&nbsp;
One place we wish we had spent more time at was the <a href="http://www.polynesia.com/">Polynesian
Cultural Center</a>.&nbsp; We were surprised at how much it had to offer.&nbsp;
