      <p><i>One of the most dynamic Church experiences affordable to
members
of the <a href="http://www.lds.org/">Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day
Saints</a> is the opportunity to serve a <a href="http://www.mission.net/">mission</a>.&nbsp;
When one has decided to serve a mission, the sacrifice consists of a
departure
from family, friends, and the conveniences of home to live for up to
two
years in one of hundreds of different <a href="http://www.ldsmissions.net/">missions</a>
in the world.&nbsp; The location is up entirely to Church leaders and
is
completely unknown to the missionary until the correspondence from
Church
Headquarters arrives with the President's signature.</i>

            <p><img src="mission01.jpg" align="left" height="235" width="360">My older sister
Renee decided to serve a mission in 1990.&nbsp; She was called to
Spain,
but was not able to get there because of visa problems.&nbsp; She ended
up serving in the Oakland, California mission. When I saw the wonderful
experiences she had and the incredible growth she underwent, I knew
that
I needed to serve a mission also.&nbsp; I sent in my papers before my
21st
birthday and was called to the Buenos Aires North mission in
Argentina.&nbsp;
After spending two months learning Spanish in the MTC (Missionary
Training
Center), I was on my way.

is a beautiful country with quite a diversity of people and
terrain.&nbsp;
The citizens range from Native Americans to European descent to
transplants
from Africa in search of work.&nbsp; Buenos Aires looks like any major
city you would find in the US with the exception of Spanish being the
language
of choice.&nbsp; I quickly found that the Spanish I learned was nothing
like what I was hearing.&nbsp; There was no English accent and they
spoke
ten times faster.&nbsp; The first month I had a constant headache from
concentrating so hard to understand.&nbsp; Lucky for me they were
patient
with me and I received an Argentine as my second companion which
improved
my language immensely.&nbsp; Argentina stretches from the tropics to
the
Arctic with every kind of climate in between.&nbsp; There are some
beautiful
places that I would love to visit someday.&nbsp; <a href="suzanne_argentina.htm">Click
here</a> for a small sample of Argentine glory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easy
to love the people of Argentina because they are so warm and loving
themselves.

            <img src="mission03.jpg" align="left" height="232" width="350">My first area
was called Floresta.&nbsp; Coming from the small town of Tollhouse to
the
huge city of Buenos Aires was a culture shock all in itself.&nbsp; The
view you see in the picture is from my first apartment.&nbsp; Nothing
but
buildings as far as the eye can see.&nbsp; The apartment was one room,
with a tiny kitchen and a minuscule bathroom off of it.&nbsp; My
companion
and I shared it with another set of sister missionaries.&nbsp; Most of
our furniture consisted of crates and that was true for every area I
was
assigned to.&nbsp; I was there for 5 months and had 3 different
companions,
Hermana (Sister in spanish, hereafter noted as Hna.) Lewis of Utah,
Hna.
Conde of Montevideo, Uruguay, and Hna. Perez of Mar Del Plata,
Argentina.
