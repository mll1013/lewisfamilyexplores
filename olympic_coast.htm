Coast Wilderness Trail<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Nine months ago,
the leaders and scouts of BSA unit 655 decided to do a 50-mile backpack
along the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/wilderness-coast.htm">Washington
coastline</a> inside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm">Olympic National
Park</a>.
&nbsp;Two groups, hiking in opposite directions were to traverse
the 50 miles of rugged coastline between <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/shi-shi-beach-olympic-wilderness.htm">Shi
Shi Beach</a> and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/oil-city-trail.htm">Oil
City</a>.&nbsp; A shuttle would be arranged to allow for the
12-mile
portage around the Quillayute River between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Push,_Washington">La
Push, WA</a> and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/rialto-beach.htm">Rialto
Beach</a>. &nbsp;The plan called for a six-day / five-night
itinerary.&nbsp;
I went with the Varsity team, which took on the south-to-north trip,
while the venturing crew took the north-to-south direction.&nbsp;
For
the Olympic Peninsula, the weather was sensational.&nbsp; There was
one
day that was soggy for a couple of hours, early morning mists tended to
dampen our tents while the morning breeze off the ocean would quickly
dry them off, and marine layers were the norm in the mornings and
evenings.&nbsp; However, the temperatures were pleasant, and we
stayed
relatively dry.&nbsp; We were also treated to sensational sunsets
twice.&nbsp; I was a bit surprised at the lack of
wildlife.&nbsp; We
did see plenty of Bald Eagles, a Leopard Seal, and a handful of Otters,
along with the typical tide/beach life, but for one of the most remote
stretches of coastline along the Pacific Ocean, I was expecting a lot
more.&nbsp; It should be noted that this trail is not simply a
stroll
along the beach.&nbsp; This is a primitive trail that throws
various
kinds of difficult terrain at you one after the other.&nbsp; From
soft
sand, loose gravel, boulder scrambling, driftwood, fallen trees, tidal
moonscapes, steep headlands and muddy overland trails, the Olympic
Coast is a rugged experience that I couldn't not have mentally or
physically prepared myself for except by doing it.<br>

<h3>Trip Log</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Day
1</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> -
Oil City TH to Mosquito Creek CG</span>:
&nbsp;</span> We planned on a 5:30am departure, but ended up
leaving a
little late as it took a while to get all of the gear loaded up.
&nbsp;We stopped at the Quinault Wilderness Information Center,
where we got our permits and bear cannisters. &nbsp;The rangers had
us on our way pretty quickly. &nbsp;By the time we left <a href="https://flic.kr/p/Jif7bK">the
trailhead</a>, we were about 40 minutes behind schedule, but
fortunately,
we had planned about an hour of buffer to make a critical tide window
that was needed to get into <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K7Gfta">Jefferson
Cove</a>. &nbsp;We had to
traverse a beach largely <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K7Gh1i">strewn
with gravel and rocks</a> with one small
section of <a href="https://flic.kr/p/Jif6AM">boulders</a>
before making the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K7Gf8a">overland
trail</a> around the
impassable Hoh Head. &nbsp;A steep rope and wooden ladder took our
group up 300 feet to a long 3.5 mile <a href="https://flic.kr/p/Jif4dF">slog of mud</a> before
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5tdJN">dropping down</a>
to Mosquito Creek, where we <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNG2oj">camped
for the night</a>. &nbsp;Mosquito Creek
is actually a lovelier spot than the name might suggest. &nbsp;It
had
one of the best water sources we had all trip, and the breeze on the
beach was too brisk for the little critters to brave. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Day 2</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> - Mosquito Creek CG to
Third Beach CG</span>:
&nbsp; </span>We got warmed up with an easy hike along the
beach.&nbsp; Since the tide was out, we were able to hike on the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNG1PJ">wet packed sand</a>,
which was everyone's favorite hiking terrain possible since it was
flat, and our hiking boots didn't sink into the ground.&nbsp; Just
before the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JiaWPh">overland
trail</a>, we found a <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFZF1">cool
rock to explore</a> with an <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5taYY">arch
that opened to the ocean</a>.&nbsp; One of the only
waterfalls to be found along the way was on <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JiaWvG">Goodman Creek</a>,
where we had to ford through a wide ankle-deep stream.&nbsp; It
made
for a great spot to eat lunch that ended as soon as the rain began to
fall.&nbsp; We agreed that <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JieXqt">the
seastacks</a> near Toleak Point are among the best to be found
along the entire coastline.&nbsp; We endured a couple more shorter <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JieWt8">overland trails</a>
along with an increasing number of dayhikers before arriving at our
campsite on <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JieUUr">Third Beach</a>.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

sunny start</a> to our short and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5t6Hy">easy hike</a> up to
our car shuttle at the Third Beach trailhead. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>While
this would be our longest day of hiking, we were glad that it was
broken up by the shuttle, which allowed us to restock our food supply,
pick up a clean change of clothes, grab some clean water, and use a
flush toilet... the last we would see for three days!<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

- Rialto Beach TH to Norwegian Memorial CG</span>:
&nbsp; </span><a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5t6cd">Rialto
Beach</a> was teeming with beachcombers, and who could blame them
on such a beautiful day.&nbsp; However, once we got past <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JieTrg">Hole-in-the-Wall</a>,
the crowds thinned out quickly.&nbsp; We found ourselves traversing
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5t565">interesting rock
formations</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JieS9g">boulder
scrambles</a>, and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JiaMnS">moonscape
tide pools</a>
before taking a quick break only to realize we had to meet a critical
tide window past Johnson Cove.&nbsp; After a string of long
beaches, we
had one last <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JiePAR">sketchy
overland descent</a> before dropping into our planned campsite at
Cedar Creek.&nbsp; As <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFNwY">a
beautiful sunset</a> formed while we dragged ourselves into camp,
we <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFNSY">spotted a
familiar-looking set of backpackers</a> who invited us to camp
with them at Norwegian Memorial, just on the otherside of a final <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFMzC">overland trail</a>.&nbsp;

Day 4</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
- Norwegian Memorial CG to Sand Point CG</span>:
&nbsp; </span>A shorter, yet <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFKTG">rugged</a> day awaited
us on our hike to Sand Point.&nbsp; A stretch of the coast that
consisted of nearly five miles of <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JiaFkS">boulders</a>,
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/KeDeoH">moonscapes</a>,
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFKTG">tide pools</a>
kept us on our toes and rolled more than one ankle along the
way.&nbsp;
It was a sufficiently challenging and tiring stretch that we decided to
hang out at Yellow Banks for some well-deserved <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFMjC">rest</a> and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/KbGfY9">recreation</a>.&nbsp;
As we <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JiaDmw">headed out for
the final push</a> for the day, we had to crawl through <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFK6E">a tiny arch</a> and
make our way over <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFJMJ">a
beautiful headland</a> that contained some <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFJHA">prime tide pools</a>.&nbsp;
The site of one of the longest stretches of <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFJ8C">packed sand beach</a>
made for a welcomed push into <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JieJ2e">camp</a>
where we arrived with time to take a dip in the ocean, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFHJm">relax at camp</a>, and
enjoy <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JieHkV">another
wonderful sunset</a> atop a <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JieHwr">rocky
point</a>.<br>

Day 5</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
- Sand Point CG</span>:
&nbsp; </span>At
the encouragement of the venturing crew, we modified our itinerary to
avoid a stretch of coastline between Cape Alava and Shi Shi Beach that
would've been very difficult to succeed on.&nbsp; As such, we
decided
to stay at Sand Point and exit the coast at Lake Ozette
instead.&nbsp;
While this means we didn't get the full 50 miles, it made for an
experience that would prove to still be very hard and yet also be
rewarding. So, day 5 It was a complete down day for us, and I can't
help but wonder if this might have been one of the favorite days of all
for many of the scouts.&nbsp; We filled the day by <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5tqHs">playing cards</a>,
exploring the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/KeDJXn">amenities
of the beach</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5tpLh">connecting
as a group</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5tp6j">climbing
rocks</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/KeDGZK">enjoying
the views</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5touj">exploring
the tide pools</a>, and discovering the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/KeDGGR">creative ways that campers
had set up campsites</a>.&nbsp; Since this was our last night
of high-adventure, we decided to end with a <a href="https://flic.kr/p/KeDGop">candlelight vigil</a>,
made from <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5tnYQ">Babybel wax
wrappers and local products</a>.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

Day 6a</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
- Morning Hike to Cape Alava</span>:
&nbsp; </span>While we couldn't rope any of the boys to get
up with us at 5:30am, Adam and I took a morning hike up to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/KeDFGz">Cape Alava</a> to
check out this part of the coastline ending at &nbsp; <a href="https://flic.kr/p/K5tnuo">Tskawahyah Island</a>,
the western-most point in the contiguous 48 United States.&nbsp;
The
hiking wasn't too bad through this section, and even though we made all
of the tide windows, we decided to scale the brief overland section at <a href="https://flic.kr/p/JNFGKC">Wedding Rocks</a> for
a better view of the area.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

<h4>Elevation Profile&nbsp;</h4>
While there isn't much true elevation gain on this itinerary, there are
enough overland trails with ups and downs to add up to 7500 feet.
&nbsp;The following profile is colored by speed. &nbsp;As
expected, our speed was much greater on flat sections (2-3 MPH), while
climbing and traversing the overland trails dropped our speed
significantly (0-2 MPH).
