Due to an&nbsp;early thunderstorm that rolled in, we all tucked ourselves in pretty early, which was a blessing, since we were going to need to be fresh for a long and tough day four.&nbsp; (Start time: 9:31am, End Time: 5:04pm.)</P><P style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><U>Day 4</U>:&nbsp;Having retired pretty early, I woke up around 5:15am and figured I'd take the opportunity to walk over to Image Lake to <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9428430667/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">watch the sun rise on Glacier Peak</A>.&nbsp; Thanks to the thunderstorm the night before, the skies cleared up, and the haze was gone, allowing for some <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431200672/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">great reflections of the peak on the lake</A>.&nbsp; After packing up,&nbsp;we headed back down <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431205592/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">Miners Ridge</A> and dropped into <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9428439173/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">Miners Creek</A> before making the ascent to <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431194724/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">Middle Ridge</A>.&nbsp; The 1800-foot climb was a kicker that can only be described by <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431211352/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">the&nbsp;carnage found&nbsp;at the summit</A>.&nbsp; We were encouraged that the worst was behind us as we descended to <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431212472/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">Small Creek</A>, but were completely unaware that a similarly graded climb up 1100 feet to Buck Creek Pass&nbsp;still lay ahead of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, we would say <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9428443153/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">farewell to Glacier Peak</A> shortly before arriving at <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431213902/in/set-72157634918412368/lightbox/">our foggy campsite</A>.&nbsp;(Start time: 9:05am, End Time: 5:25pm.)</P><P style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><U>Day 5</U>:&nbsp;Waking up to <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431339860/in/set-72157634911949279/lightbox/">a soggy camp</A>, we packed up as quickly as we could and began the descent to the Chiwawa River trailhead.&nbsp; <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431339220/in/set-72157634911949279/lightbox/">The fog</A> insisted on keeping Glacier Peak hidden from us&nbsp;on our final day, but we still enjoyed&nbsp;occasional glimpses of <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9431338208/in/set-72157634911949279/lightbox/">the scenery around us</A>.&nbsp; Crossing the <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9428577633/in/set-72157634911949279/lightbox/">Chiwawa River</A> was a welcomed indication that we were on the home stretch.&nbsp; The boys really booked it on this day... I hardly ever saw them ahead on the trail.&nbsp; I suspect it was because everyone was thinking about burgers and fries at <A href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/zekes-drive-in-gold-bar">Zeke's drive-in</A> on the way back home, which has become a mandatory ending to these backpack trips this summer.&nbsp; (Start time: 8:18am, End Time: 1:08pm.)</P><H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Final Thoughts</H3><P style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">I think I can speak for the whole group that the trip was an amazing experience.&nbsp; We all came to commune with the beauty of nature like never before, and gained a renewed gratitude for the Earth that God created for us.&nbsp; It was appropriate that we read through the entire booklet, <A href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399460.The_Holy_Temple">The Holy Temple</A>, by <A href="https://www.lds.org/church/leader/boyd-k-packer?lang=eng">Boyd K. Packer</A>.&nbsp; We all made a symbolic connection with the temple-like nature of Glacier Peak Wilderness and learned more about the purpose of temples.&nbsp; Unfortunately, one member of our group, Hollan, was quite ill the entire trip and had a hard time holding down much food.&nbsp; While he was able to stay hydrated, he wasn't able to consume many calories.&nbsp; That he was able to hike nearly 50 miles, climb over 10,000 feet of elevation, and carry a backpack in the meantime with enough energy and strength is nothing short of a miracle.&nbsp; I trust that the prayers offered and the blessing of health that he received were contributing factors to his safe return from the wilderness.&nbsp; I am certain that many testimonies of God's truths were strengthened, including my own!</P><H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Photos</H3><P style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/collections/72157634918568712/">Here</A> is a collection of&nbsp;online photos.&nbsp; Other pictures were taken by David Mann and Dave Christie as well.</P><H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">GPS Info</H3><DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">
