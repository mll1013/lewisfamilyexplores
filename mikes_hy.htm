      <p><i>After serving as a zone leader for six months, I was nearing the
end of my mission.&nbsp; The APs (assistants to the President) asked me
if I wanted to finish as a "zoni."&nbsp; I told them that I absolutely
did not.&nbsp; I wanted to return to the rank and file of the proselyting
missionary&mdash;teaching the people of Argentina, instead of handling the administrative
matters of the mission.&nbsp; So, they gave me my third "greenie" (brand
new missionary) and a brand new area to open.&nbsp;</i>

people of Hipolito Yrigoyen (pronounced ee-POE-lee-toe &middot; ee-ree-GO-zhen)
were very surprised to see us at first.&nbsp; None of them had ever seen
a Mormon missionary before, and they stared at us with amazement, wondering
why on earth two pale-complected young men were wandering their streets
dressed in slacks, white shirt, and tie!&nbsp; After being offered a live
interview by the local radio station, the people not only warmed up to
us but found a place deep in our hearts.&nbsp; Shown here were some of
the first (and most prepared) investigators of the Church in Yrigoyen.</td>

Even though it was a brand new area, the branch started with the 5
members of the Ola family.&nbsp; Orignially members of the <a href="mikes_oran.htm">Oran</a>
branch, the branch split found them inside the Yrigoyen branch, and that
was great, too, since they were pioneers of the Church in Northern Argentina.&nbsp;
At the time, Brother Ola was serving in the district presidency, so he
possessed the leadership capabilities to establish the Church in this small
outpost.</td>

the sun set on my mission, I was grateful to have the opportunity to finish
in Yrigoyen.&nbsp; It was another town of great people with great attitudes
towards their brothers and sisters. Even without the Church in their area,
they could sense that we are all one big family... children of our Heavenly
Father.&nbsp; Someday, I will have the opportunity to see this "extended
family" of mine, and I will be grateful for the wonderful, heavenly reunion
that it will be.</td>
