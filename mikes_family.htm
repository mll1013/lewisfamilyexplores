Lewis (<i>Father)</i></b></dt>
      </dl>
My father was born in Ardmore, Oklahoma to <a href="#grandparents">Leonard
and Helen Lewis</a>.&nbsp; He worked for over 35 years as a
meat cutter
for various grocery stores and meat markets.&nbsp; He was always a
faithful
provider for his family, making sure there was plenty of food, clothes,
and extra comforts for us.&nbsp; He was always very supportive of
my decisions.
Even when he thought I was making a mistake by leaving my <a href="http://www.csufresno.edu/">collegiate
studies</a> for two years to serve a <a href="http://www.mission.net/argentina/salta/">mission</a>
for the <a href="http://www.lds.org/">Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day
Saints</a>, he still accepted my decision and supported my fully
in that
venture. &nbsp;After a lifetime of substance abuse, he succumbed to&nbsp;<a onclick="wmdSearchTrack('results_1')" href="http://www.webmd.com/hw-popup/Cirrhosis">Cirrhosis</a> on 7 April 2006.
      <p><b>Jo Ann Rash <i>(Mother)</i></b>
      <br>
Mom is a product of Fresno, California and has lived in the Fresno
area for her entire life.&nbsp; Mom met Dad at <a href="http://www.cms.k12.nm.us/CHS/index.html">Clovis
High School, </a>and they became sweethearts there.&nbsp;
She was my best
friend through my childhood and adolescence.&nbsp; I confided
easily in
her, even with topics that most children find embarrassing to discuss
with
their parents.&nbsp; She's been a tremendous example of sacrifice
to me,
as she has given up her entire life in devotion to her family,
especially
to my handicapped brother, who she&nbsp; attended to unceasingly for the
last 20 years of his life.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><a name="brother"></a><b>Timothy
Lewis <i>(Brother)</i></b> <br>
Seven years my elder, Tim was born on on 13 July 1962.&nbsp; On
November,
15, 1981 he was in an automobile accident.&nbsp; He was eighteen
years
old--a recent graduate from Sierra High School in Tollhouse,
California.&nbsp;
Tim always lived life on the edge.&nbsp; On that dreadful November
day,
he was a passenger in a pick-up truck.&nbsp; Both he and his friend
had
too much to drink and were going too fast for the curves on Auberry
Road
just a couple of miles from our home.&nbsp; The truck went off the
road
and flipped end over end several times.&nbsp; He was thrown out and
wrapped
around an oak tree like a horseshoe, causing severe internal injuries
and
brain damage.&nbsp; He was on the edge of life and death, but after
spending
a couple of months in a coma and several more months in therapy,
Timothy
was able to survive the incident.&nbsp; The brain damage
nonetheless confines
him to a wheelchair.&nbsp; Happily, Tim and I have always had an
incredibly
close relationship, even with the seven years of age difference that
separates
us. &nbsp;Tim passed away with congestive heart failure, a complication
of his physical handicap and inactivity, on 19 May 2002. </p>
      <p><a name="grandparents"></a><b>Grandparents</b>
      </p>
      <p>All of my grandparents are now deceased. &nbsp;My remaining
grandmother, Eunice Carmassi (Maiden
name: Blevins) just passed away on 28 Mar 2007.
She was a retired assembly line operation, from whose vending machines
you
may have extracted a soda or two.&nbsp; She loved to quilt,
crochet,
and enjoyed the company of her grandchildren and great
grandchildren.&nbsp; She had been
widowed
for nearly 40 years, which is both amazing and also a bit sad.&nbsp; My
grandfather, Thomas Rash, died in April 1967, a couple of years before
I
was born. </p>
      <p>My paternal grandfather, Leonard Lewis was a World War
II veteran, who
survived the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the battles of Midway and
Normandy.
He was my first close relative to pass away in 1997.&nbsp; I was
honored
to offer the eulogy at his funeral.&nbsp; Whenever I think of him
now,
I am pleased to remember his achievements.&nbsp; My Grandmother,
Helen
Pritchard, joined him in death in 2000.&nbsp; I also offered
remarks of
gratitude at her funeral.&nbsp; Her hard work and endlessly
cheerful nature
were deep losses to our family and the world.</p>
      <p><b>Wife and Children</b></p>
      <p>I married Kimberly <a href="suzanne.htm">Suzanne</a> Loyd on
11 August 1995. &nbsp;We've enjoyed a wonderful relationship and feel
like we were extracted from the same mold. &nbsp;We both enjoy the
same things, have extremely similar beliefs, feelings, and goals in
life. &nbsp;Being so much alike has made life all the easier, since we
rarely disagree, and when we do, we are always able to respect each
other's opinion.</p>
      <p>Raising children is both a joy and a challenge, as any parent will attest. &nbsp;I truly believe that life without <a href="amelia.htm">Amelia</a> and <a href="raymond.htm">Raymond</a>
would not be nearly as exciting or fulfilling. &nbsp;They are both
intelligent and love to read... gee, where could they get those traits
from. &nbsp;While they have not been giving much athletic exposure from
us, they certainly are being trained to love the outdoors. &nbsp;Both
of them love to go camping whenever we get the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Since moving to Idaho in 2005, we have invited some foster
children into our home. &nbsp;First, we had Trent, who stayed with us
for about a year and a half before being placed with an aunt and uncle
for adoption. &nbsp;Having been in foster care since birth, we are
excited that he'll get to have the stability of a forever family.</p>
      <p>In January 2007, a case worker called us with an urgent need.
&nbsp;Two adorable little girls had been taken out of their home and
placed into an over-crowded home with nine other foster children.
&nbsp;We thought to ourselves, "Gee, we have this big house and it's
just the four of us..." &nbsp;So we&nbsp;couldn't pass up the
opportunity to serve them for a while. &nbsp;Isabella (20 months old
when she arrived) and Bailey (4 months old when she arrived) are both
sweet and patient spirits who we are glad to have with us. &nbsp;They
have visits with their mom twice a week while she tries to fix some
things in her life. She is hopeful to have her girls back with her
permanently some day soon.</p>

My <a href="ghtindex.htm">family tree</a> pages
were supplied to me by
Suzanne's parents, Monty
and Cris Loyd.&nbsp;
They found the <a href="mike_family_history_ged.zip">GEDCOM</a>
source
file for this line of my family on the internet.&nbsp; It contains
a list
of over 1500 of my relatives, mainly on my mother's side of the
family.&nbsp;
I hope to complete some more of my father's line and will post that
information
here as it becomes available.&nbsp; <a href="ghtindex.htm">These
pages</a>
contain my direct line of ancestors... over 20 in all, spanning 9
generations!
