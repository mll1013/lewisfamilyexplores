      <i>So how did Mike ever get mixed up with those Mormons anyway?&nbsp;
Good question.&nbsp; I'm glad you asked, because the answer is one of the
most fortunate in my life.&nbsp; Mormonism is the common term for the religion
practised by members of the <a href="http://www.lds.org/">Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.</a>&nbsp; Much can be read online to get a
flavor of the religion and culture of Mormonism.&nbsp; The information
here describes my personal association with the Church.</i>

      <center><b>How it All Started</b></center>
      <p>Shortly after <a href="mikes_family.htm#brother">my brother&rsquo;s</a> accident,
I began seeing some of the difficult realities we all must face in life.&nbsp;
First, I realized how close my brother came to dying, and I started pondering
the meaning of death.&nbsp; I needed an answer, because through my brother,
I learned that death can (and often does) come without warning.&nbsp; When
would my turn come?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d heard that many believe in a life after death.&nbsp;
Was there such a life?&nbsp; Was there a God who could make such a life
possible?&nbsp; And since we all will inevitably die, what is the meaning
of living in the first place?&nbsp; And if there is a God who loves us,
then why does he allow so much suffering?&nbsp; Why were there wars, crime,
poverty, disease?&nbsp; These were just a few of the questions that troubled
me.

      <p><b>Introduction to the Church</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>My first knowledge of the <a href="http://www.lds.org/">Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> came when I was four or five. I was with
my mother and we saw a couple of missionaries riding their bicycles in
Fresno.&nbsp; Because they were such an odd sight, I pointed them out and
asked her who they were.&nbsp; She said they were Mormons.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t say anything else, but I thought it was odd.&nbsp; Here were two
young men dressed in business suits riding bicycles.&nbsp; I could only
draw one conclusion, which stuck with me for the next fifteen year--Mormons
were obviously affluent business people who were too tight to buy a car!&nbsp;

      <p><b>Fifteen Years Later</b></p>
      </center>
My cousin, Candy, was baptized in April, 1988 and she told me about the
story of <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,104-1-3-1,FF.html">Joseph
Smith</a> and the <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/contents">Book
of Mormon</a>.&nbsp; I respected her opinions and beliefs about Mormonism,
but after I left her, I just couldn&rsquo;t help to think how sad it was that
millions of people could buy such a ridiculous story.&nbsp;
      <p>One day Candy was talking about some of the mutual friends we had that
were members of the Church.&nbsp; I never knew these people were Mormon,
but I really respected each of them.&nbsp; They set such great examples.&nbsp;
Having discovered this, I was a little more interested in the Church, so
I went with her one Sunday, and I enjoyed it, so I went again and again.&nbsp;
Finally she invited me to listen to the discussions and I accepted.&nbsp;
Two missionaries taught me these discussions.&nbsp; Amazingly, the Gospel
had answers to all of the questions I&rsquo;d struggled with for so many years.&nbsp;
But how would I know if the answers were true?&nbsp; The missionaries showed
me the method in <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/moro/10/3-5#3">Moroni 10:3-5</a>.
      </p>
      <p>As Moroni suggested, I began to read the Book of Mormon and pray about
it.&nbsp; For the first few weeks, I didn&rsquo;t receive an answer, but one
night I read <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/alma/5/45-46#45">Alma 5:45-46</a>,
and for the first time, I actually could hear those words spoken by a real
man who lived thousands of years ago.&nbsp; All of a sudden, it seemed
real, not fictitious.&nbsp; The light bulb came on and I felt something
in my heart as I never had before.&nbsp; Could it be that the influence
of the <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,11-1-13-12,00.html">Holy
Ghost</a> the missionaries had taught me about?&nbsp; I kneeled down by
my bed and asked Heavenly Father if I was indeed feeling the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;
The answer was inexplicable, yet profound and immediate.&nbsp; I knew right
there that the <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/contents">Book of
Mormon</a> was true, and shortly thereafter on my nineteenth birthday,
I was baptized and confirmed a member of the <a href="http://www.lds.org/">Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</a>

      <p><b>Growing in the Gospel</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I have grown in my knowledge of the truthfulness of the Church.&nbsp;
Many spiritual experiences along the journey of life has testified to me
that <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,163-1-10-1,FF.html">Jesus
Christ</a> is indeed our Savior.&nbsp; I will never forget the first really
special experience I had as a member of the Church.&nbsp; It came in the
most unexpected of occasions.&nbsp; I had been called to serve as a juror
on a sexual assault case in Fresno.&nbsp; The case involved a man named
Jimmie Lee Henry, who was accused of sexually molesting his stepdaughter
for a period of years.&nbsp; The trial lasted for four weeks, and I had
been <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,11-1-13-13,00.html">praying</a>
for guidance in making my decision.&nbsp; I was terrified at the thought
of holding this man&rsquo;s future in my hands.&nbsp; I knew that the <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,11-1-13-12,00.html">Holy
Ghost</a> could guide me.&nbsp; That gift was given to me during my confirmation.&nbsp;
So I prayed every single day that I would be led to the correct decision.&nbsp;
Deliberations lasted four days.&nbsp; By the end of the time, all of us
jurors grew frustrated at our inability to arrive at a unanimous decision
on all nine charges filed against the defendant.&nbsp; During the last
day, I felt like we needed to hear the testimony of one of the witnesses,
who was a police officer.&nbsp; I neglected the thought, because we had
already reviewed his testimony once.&nbsp; What good would it do to review
it again?&nbsp; However, I couldn&rsquo;t get the thought out of my head, so
I requested the court stenographer return to read it once again.&nbsp;
The jurors were patient with my request.&nbsp; We all listened intently,
but this time we continued reviewing part of it that we hadn&rsquo;t previously.&nbsp;
As the stenographer read something, I came to an instant realization of
what had happened.&nbsp; There was no denying the man&rsquo;s guilt.&nbsp; I
looked around the table to notice that the looks on all of the other jurors
similarly showed that all had received the same revelation that I had.&nbsp;
Within an hour or two, we organized everything, and came to the correct
conclusion.&nbsp; I will never forget what a significant role the Holy
Ghost can play in inspiring us in making correct decisions if we will heed
its counsel.
      </p>
      <p>My testimony was true, but still weak at first.&nbsp; Nineteen years
of beliefs and habits couldn&rsquo;t be changed in such a short period of time.&nbsp;
However, I studied the gospel with great interest and excitement, and my
testimony continued to grow, until it became unquestionable a year later
in the <a href="http://www.mission.net/en/main_mtcfaq.html">Missionary
Training Center</a> in Provo, Utah when Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the <a href="http://www.desnews.com/confer/leaders/b.htm">Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles</a> shared his fervent testimony of the prophet
      <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,104-1-3-1,FF.html">Joseph
Smith</a>.
&nbsp;As I left that meeting, the thought occurred to me that here was
a man who shared his testimony of the organizer of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints. &nbsp;He told us that he "knew" that
Joseph was a prophet. &nbsp;What gain did he have in doing this?
&nbsp;Why would he give up a profitable professional career to travel
the world over on an exhausting schedule to tell of things he "knew" if
he truly didn't believe them! &nbsp;The only conclusion could be that
he did firmly believe what he was saying. &nbsp;After this train of
intellectual thought, the Holy Ghost whispered to my spirit what the
logic was telling my head: &nbsp;that this apostle was flat out telling
the truth. &nbsp;He "knew" what he was telling us was true. &nbsp;And
from then on, I have never doubted that I also "know" what the God has
confirmed in my heart to be true. </p>
