      <p><i>Joaquin V. Gonzalez, in the province of <a href="http://www.welcomesalta.com.ar/">Salta</a>,
was my most remote area.&nbsp; The nearest missionaries were one and a
half hours to the west by way of a hot bus over a bumpy dirt road.&nbsp;
Without a telephone, we were completely cut off from mission communication.
The smallest branch in my mission (and perhaps the Church!) there were
only five members when I was called to serve as a missionary and Branch
President in Gonzalez.&nbsp; The embarrassment was that when I left, there
were only four members... one had moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires">Buenos
Aires</a>.</i>

think this picture looks like the it was taken in the worst part of Gonzalez,
you'd be mistaken.&nbsp; This is Main Street, the widest and most maintained
street in the entire town of several thousand residents.&nbsp; When I was
there, there was very few paved roads, and they were mainly situated near
the highway that ran through town.</td>

is a typical cemetary in the poorer parts of Argentina.&nbsp; You'll notice
an absence of grass anywhere on the facilities.&nbsp; In its place lies
hundreds of above-ground cement boxes where the remains of the deceased
are deposited.&nbsp; For those who are cremated, another cement box is
built resembling the safety deposit valut of a bank.&nbsp; The main differences
is that ashes, not riches, are deposited into these boxes for safekeeping.
To note some contrast, take a look at the cemetary I photographed in <a href="mikes_sgo.htm">Santiago
del Estero</a>, a provincial capital with notably more financial capability
than Gonzalez.</td>
