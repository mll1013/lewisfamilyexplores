<p><em>I love to read.&nbsp; There's just one
problem, however.&nbsp; I never find or make the time to do
it.&nbsp; But, I do have some solutions. &nbsp;Sometimes, I
check out books on&nbsp;CD from one of the local public libraries
and listen during my commute to and from work. &nbsp;At other
times, I'll download audiobooks from </em><a href="http://librivox.org/"><em>LivriVox</em></a><em>
and listen while doing work around the house. &nbsp;On business
trips, I take the opportunity to read on the airplane.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I am using </em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/"><em>Goodreads</em></a><em>
to keep track of the </em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7959156-michael-lewis?format=html&amp;shelf=read"><em>books
I have read</em></a><em>, track the progress of </em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7959156-michael-lewis?format=html&amp;shelf=currently-reading"><em>those
I'm currently reading</em></a><em>,&nbsp;and keep
track of </em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7959156-michael-lewis?format=html&amp;shelf=to-read"><em>those
I still want to get around to</em></a><em> some
day.&nbsp; Currently, I have over 250 titles that I've read and
hopefully, many more to come.&nbsp; I also have a list of my </em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7959156-michael-lewis?format=html&amp;shelf=favorites&amp;sort=position"><em>favorite
books</em></a><em>.&nbsp; </em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10355062-el-ingenioso-hidalgo-don-quijote-de-la-mancha">El
Ingenioso Hildago Don Quixote de la Mancha</a><em> is my
all-time favorite.&nbsp; A novel that parodies novels...&nbsp;I
just love it!&nbsp; When read in the romantic Spanish language in
which it was written, you get all of the feeling that </em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4037220.Miguel_de_Cervantes_Saavedra"><em>Miguel
de Cervantes</em></a><em> intended.&nbsp; Comical
as well as thought-provoking, it has stood the test of time well and
certainly deserves a place in the realms of immortal
literature.&nbsp; In fact, I didn't realize this until recently,
but in an effort by a Norwegian book club to complie a&nbsp;list of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_100_Best_Books_of_All_Time">the
best 100 literary works</a> of all time, as voted upon by 100
writers from over 50 different cultures, Don Quixote was revered as the
"best literary work ever written"</em>.</p>
<p><em>In the past few years, I have taken an
interest in writing as well.&nbsp; After publishing my first novel,
</em>"<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Orthogonal-Galaxy-Book-ebook/dp/B00QD35580/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8">The
Orthogonal Galaxy</a>"<em> I will be publishing the sequel,
</em>"The Twisted Galaxy"<em> soon. If all goes according to plan, the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/141689-galaxy-series">Galaxy
Series</a> will be a six-book </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_sci_fi"><em>hard
Science Fiction </em></a><em> series of novels about the
accidental discovery of a parallel Earth by a team of astronomy
graduate students at Cal Tech.&nbsp; While researching a mysterious
phenomenon that endangers the lives of three astronauts on
Mars,&nbsp;the unlikely group stumbles onto one of the biggest
astronomical discoveries of all time.&nbsp; Their discovery turns
the physics world upside-down, as well as the lives of&nbsp;two
unlikely heroes who travel 27,000 light years to make contact this
new&nbsp;world, which may not be as parallel as originally
believed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; <img style="width: 150px; height: 225px;" alt="The Orthogonal Galaxy" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MH6hjpPrL.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p>
