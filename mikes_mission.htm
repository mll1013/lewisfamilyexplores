      <p><i>One of the most dynamic Church experiences
affordable to members
of the <a href="http://www.lds.org/">Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day
Saints</a> is the opportunity to serve a <a href="http://www.mission.net/">mission</a>.&nbsp;
When one has decided to serve a mission, the sacrifice consists of a
departure
from family, friends, and the conveniences of home to live for up to
two
years in one of hundreds of different <a href="http://www.ldsmissions.net/">missions</a>
in the world.&nbsp; The location is up entirely to Church leaders
and is
completely unknown to the missionary until the correspondance from
Church
Headquarters arrives with the President's signature.</i> <br>

            <p>I never knew about the full-time missionary
program until a couple of
months after my baptism.&nbsp; There were no full-time missionaries
in
my ward, and so I had never personally met any of them.&nbsp; A
friend
of mine from the institute was also a convert, and he filled me in on
the
program, because he was about to go to <a href="http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/7/0,5716,119327+1+110436,00.html">France</a>
to serve his mission.&nbsp; I went to the <a href="http://www.flyfresno.org/fyiindex.htm">airport</a>
as he departed and felt the Spirit tell me that I too must
serve.&nbsp;
My <a href="mikes_family.htm#parents">father</a>
was not pleased when
I first told him.&nbsp; He wanted me to finish <a href="http://www.csufresno.edu/">college</a>
first, but I didn&rsquo;t want to wait.&nbsp; Within a couple
of weeks, his heart
had been softened, and he not only allowed me to serve, but was fully
supportive
and excited about it. </p>
            <p>Just months prior to my departure to the <a href="http://www.hh2.com/mas/">Argentina,
Salta mission</a>, I was called as a stake missionary in my ward,
which
helped me learn the discussions.&nbsp; I also attended the
missionary preparation
classes for a year, which helped me gain a knowledge of the scriptures
I&rsquo;d refer to so frequently.&nbsp; Having read the <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/contents">Book
of Mormon</a> twice, most of the remainder of the <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/">Standard
Works</a>, and some of the missionary reference library also
prepared me. <br>

adventures in my mission to <a href="http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/0/0,5716,117953+1,00.html">Argentina</a>
to make it a very exciting experience.&nbsp; Bus trips were always
an experience.&nbsp;
Sometimes, they would be extremely late or break down in the middle of
nowhere.&nbsp; Since all of our transfers were by bus,&nbsp;
one never
knew how well a transfer would go.&nbsp; In fact, only one of my
transfers
went smoothly.&nbsp; The worst of the transfers occurred when I was
traveling
from the southern part of my mission to the northern part.&nbsp; If
all
went well, it would take fourteen hours to arrive.&nbsp; However,
all didn&rsquo;t
go well.&nbsp; It took me three days&nbsp; to arrive to my new
area, due
in large part to having to cross <i>straight through</i> a
river in the
bus due to a washed-out bridge.&nbsp; I went without any
significant sleep
for over 65 hours straight!&nbsp; I had my backpack stolen with
$100, a
camera, journal, scriptures, and other stuff in it.&nbsp; It was an
incredible
adventure. <br>

occurred in returning home
late one night from a discussion.&nbsp; My companion and I were

our bikes slowly on an extremely dark highway.&nbsp; We could
barely distinguish
the shoulder of the road from the road itself.&nbsp; Suddenly my
bike came
to an instant stop having hit an immovable object.&nbsp; My back
wheel
went straight up in the air, and I fell on top of the
obstacle.&nbsp; It
took me no time to realize the horror I faced when I my felt my hands
wrapped

its
own. <br>

            <p><img src="herrera.jpg" nosave="" align="left" height="239" width="349">One of
the greatest things to see in a mission is the way the gospel changes
lives.&nbsp;
The Herrera family was one of the first families I had taught in my
mission.&nbsp;
At first, they always argued.&nbsp; Parents yelled at children and
fought
with each other.&nbsp; We could usually hear them from 50 yards
away as
we approached their house.&nbsp; After they were baptized, my
companion
had a great idea for a series of family home evenings.&nbsp; After
singing
a hymn and praying, we placed the youngest, Fernando, in the
&ldquo;hot seat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Each member in the family expressed why they loved Fernando.&nbsp;
It was
a touching evening.&nbsp; It was hoped that they would place a
different
member of the family in the &ldquo;hot seat&rdquo; each week. </p>
            <p>On a future visit, we couldn&rsquo;t hear them
while approaching their house
as we usually did, so we assumed they weren&rsquo;t home.&nbsp;
However, we were
surprised when Sylvia opened the door.&nbsp; We were amazed at the
spirit
of love we found inside.&nbsp; Fani was holding her granddaughter
tenderly,
and the children were playing together harmoniously rather than
fighting
over the toys.&nbsp; It was a marvelous sight to behold.&nbsp;
The power
of the gospel to change lives cannot be underestimated... but then
again
I know this fact by my own personal experience with the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. <br>

never forget the lesson I learned on the power of the
priesthood.&nbsp;
Sisters Bellone and Houriet were teaching a Baptist family who decided
to get baptized in the true church.&nbsp; However, frightening
things were
happening to them during the last week.&nbsp; We had found some bad
literature
and other items in the house (such as a Ouija board) and assumed that
perhaps
Satan had more control over them through these objects.&nbsp; The
family
decided to burn all of these items.&nbsp; Afterwards, my companion
and
I blessed the mother and her two sons with the peace and comfort they
needed
in their lives at that moment.&nbsp; As I began to bless that sweet
mother,
I began to tremble and cry.&nbsp; I could feel the Spirit working
in me
as never before.&nbsp; When I opened my eyes, I was simply amazed
to discover
how calm her countenance was.&nbsp; In just a moment, all of her
fears
and anxiety were dissolved through the power of the
priesthood.&nbsp; She
knew it too, because there was no other way to explain such an
immediate
change within her.&nbsp; I will never forget how I learned on that
occasion
how powerful the priesthood really is. <br>

            <p>On my mission, I had an opportunity to grow
through the many callings
I held.&nbsp; </p>
            <ul>
              <li>As <b><i>branch president</i></b>,
I learned how to lead, how to interview,
how to set apart, and how to handle tithing and offerings.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>As <b><i>district leader</i></b>,
I taught missionaries and encouraged
them in their work.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>As <b><i>zone leader</i></b>,
I handled problems, served and trained missionaries
and conducted baptismal interviews.&nbsp; It was my least enjoyable
calling,
because it took me away from proselyting too much.&nbsp; It was
tedious
and frustrating.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>My most enjoyable calling was as a <b><i>trainer</i></b>.&nbsp;
I trained
three missionaries, and each of time I felt of their eagerness, and it
brought excitement and enthusiasm back into my life as a missionary.</li>
            </ul>
I often performed other duties on my branches as well, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>janitor;</li>
              <li>chorister in the Sunday school, priesthood, and
sacrament meetings;&nbsp;</li>
              <li>teacher in the primary, Sunday school, and
priesthood;&nbsp;</li>
              <li>and elder&rsquo;s quorum
president.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
I also found opportunities to:&nbsp;
            <ul>
              <li>conduct meetings;&nbsp;</li>
              <li>offer prayers;</li>
              <li>bless babies, houses, sick and
afflicted,&nbsp;</li>
              <li>and give talks in sacrament meeting on the
average of twice or so a month.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
In short, my mission was an experience that I wouldn&rsquo;t trade
for anything.&nbsp; <br>
