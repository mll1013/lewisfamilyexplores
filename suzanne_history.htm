            <center><b>The Beginnings</b></center>
            <p><img src="girls.jpg" align="left" height="300" width="197">I was born to Monty
Ray and Cheryl Cristine Loyd on Tuesday, November 24, 1970.&nbsp; That
Thursday was Thanksgiving which my mother proceeded to prepare for the
family.&nbsp; I was the third daughter born in the family.&nbsp; I was
followed by another daughter, and then finally a son.&nbsp; We lived in
            <a href="http://www.ci.fresno.ca.us/">Fresno</a>,
CA until I was six years old.&nbsp; Then we moved into a tiny travel
trailer
on the property in Tollhouse,
CA while our home was being built.&nbsp; Our home was a great two-story
log home that was the first one to be built in Fresno County.&nbsp; I
loved
growing up in a small rural community because it was so tight
knit.&nbsp;
My <a href="http://www.sierra.k12.ca.us/schools/sierra.htm">elementary
school</a> went from Kindergarten to 8th grade.&nbsp; My graduating
class
in <a href="http://www.sierra.k12.ca.us/highschool/">high school</a>
was
just under 200 students.&nbsp; </p>

            <p><b>Real Life</b></p>
            </center>
            <p>After graduating in 1989, I attended <a href="http://www.csufresno.edu/">California
State University of Fresno</a> on a academic scholarship that I was
fortunate
to receive.&nbsp; In 1990 my brother Rodney passed away at the age of
14
from <a href="http://www.mdchoice.com/pt/ptinfo/prim-ph.asp">primary
pulmonary
hypertension</a>.&nbsp; I took two years off from college to serve a <a href="suzanne_mission.htm">mission</a>
in Argentina and finally received a BA in Liberal Studies.&nbsp; I did
my last semester at <a href="http://www.csun.edu/">CSU Northridge</a>,
in Los Angeles because I married <a href="michael.htm">Michael Lewis</a>
in 1995.&nbsp; He was just beginning his post graduate schooling at UC
Santa Barbara.&nbsp; The commute between Santa Barbara and Northridge
was
not fun, but luckily I only had to go two days a week.&nbsp; Mike
finished
his <a href="mikes_education.htm">Masters </a>degree in December of
1996,
and we moved to <a href="http://san-diego-california.com/">San Diego</a>
for his first real job.&nbsp; In January of 1998 our first child, <a href="amelia.htm">Amelia</a>
was born into our family.&nbsp; In November of 1999, <a href="raymond.htm">Raymond</a>
joined our family.&nbsp; In January of 2000
my oldest sister Kelly passed away after suffering a massive
aneurysm.&nbsp;
Fortunately they were able to deliver her unborn son, who serves as a
great
comfort to the family.&nbsp; In 2004 we moved to Boise, Idaho and are
enjoying our life there. </p>

            <p><b>Currently</b></p>
            </center>
            <p>Life continues to have it's ups and downs.&nbsp; In June
of 2005 we had Trent Duvall join our family through the Idaho Foster
Care system.&nbsp; In October of 2006, Trent went to live with his aunt
and uncle who are planning on adopting him.&nbsp; In January of 2007,
Isabella(18 months) and Bailey Shirley(7 weeks) came to live with us
for awhile.&nbsp; I
continue to be busy with children and my calling as Primary President
at church. &nbsp; All in
all life has been good to me.
