      <P><EM>With the many enjoyable </EM><A href="mikes_books.htm"><EM>books</EM></A><EM> that
I have read, I have to say that my favorite is "<A href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84623.El_Ingenioso_Hidalgo_Don_Quijote_De_LA_Mancha">El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote De La Mancha</A>" (Translated: "The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha"),&nbsp;by&nbsp;</EM><SPAN itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" itemscope=""><A class=authorName href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4037220.Miguel_de_Cervantes_Saavedra" itemprop="url"><SPAN itemprop="name"><EM>Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</EM></SPAN></A>.&nbsp; <EM>A contemporary of Shakespeare, Cervantes is often considered the founding father of the novel.&nbsp; During his day, there were many works of </EM><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance"><EM>chivalrous fiction</EM></A><EM> being composed in his day, and treats specifically to the creation of these works and their impact on society.&nbsp; In fact, it could be said that </EM>Don Quixote <EM>is novel which is a spoof on novels, and the concept to me, in and of itself, is pure genius.&nbsp; His implementation is remarkable as well, and the work is highly regarded.&nbsp; In <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/may/08/humanities.books">one survey of 100 authors</A>, it was often considered to be the best novel ever written.&nbsp; I have read it both in Spanish, and also in English.&nbsp; While a book&nbsp;of this scope plays out much better in the romantic language in which it was penned, it is highly enjoyable using <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ormsby">John Ormsby</A>'s very faithful translation to English as well.</EM></SPAN><BR>
