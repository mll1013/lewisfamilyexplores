      <I>Mike went with a group of scouts on a backpack trip to&nbsp;the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Lakes_Wilderness">Alpine Lakes Wilderness</A>&nbsp;in the Cascade Mountains as a part of their preparations for a 50-miler this Summer.&nbsp; This was a mandatory 20-mile shakeout, and our group actually covered 22 miles and 5800 feet of elevation gain in two days.&nbsp; Unfortunately, two groups left at two different times, and the other group of scouts never caught up with us, so it was a small but&nbsp;robust&nbsp;group of scouters who actually covered the 20 miles (Chase, Cody, Eric, Russ, and Mike).&nbsp; Our intended destination was Marmot Lake, but due to <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225880847/">an impassable snow bridge across a deep ravine</A> less than a mile from the lake, we decided to abandon the attempt.&nbsp; Instead, we opted to visit Daisy and Deception Lakes as a side trip on our second day of hiking.</I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><BR>

      <H3>Report</H3><P>We started out on the trail around 11:00am, and within the first mile, we bumped up against our <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225864675/">first significant stream crossing</A>.&nbsp; Sure, we could've easily forded this one, but that would mean getting wet, and none of us were wanting to take off our boots/socks this early in the trip, so <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225864119/in/set-72157634524364498">we decided to use a log to cross</A>.&nbsp; The next crossing went a lot smoother, since there was <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225890923/in/set-72157634524364498">a carved out footbridge</A>&nbsp;to use.&nbsp; That would be the last of the easy creek crossings.&nbsp; We would use <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225890115/in/set-72157634524364498">more deadfall</A> and test our ability to <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9228667390/in/set-72157634524364498">hop across slippery rocks</A>&nbsp;more times than any of us care to remember.&nbsp; While the many crossings cost us plenty of time the first day, it was our inability to keep sight of the trail due to the many stream crossings and <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9228664362/in/set-72157634524364498">snow fields</A> that really slowed our progress.&nbsp; We were lucky enough to have an angel hiker whose solitary pair of footprints we were able to make out at some of the snow fields.&nbsp; We felt triumphant with our navigational skills (or was it luck!) everytime we would locate his footprints, as a good indicator that we were on the right track.&nbsp; While our goal was Marmot Lake, we never made it!&nbsp; Instead, we were stopped less than one mile short of reaching the lake by a <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225880847/in/set-72157634524364498">dangerous snow bridge</A> over a 20-foot ravine.&nbsp; Instead, we had to back-track to a different camp site, where we finally&nbsp;<A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225879737/in/set-72157634524364498">pitched camp</A> at 7:30pm near <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9228644282/in/set-72157634524364498">a cirque containing a glut of waterfalls</A>.&nbsp; It may well have been a more beautiful setting than Marmot Lake anyway.&nbsp; </P><P>On day two, we woke up&nbsp;and decided to take the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</A> which took us up <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225870651/in/set-72157634524364498">higher on a ridge</A> (i.e. away from all of those pesky Deception Creek crossings).&nbsp; <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9228657970/in/set-72157634524364498">After rolling up camp</A> and hitting the trail at 9:30am, we were treated to some <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9228643606/in/set-72157634524364498">wonderful panoramic scenery</A> on the PCT, and because the trail was very well-established,&nbsp;we actually made better progress on the way back (1.6MPH average instead of 1.2MPH), even though the "scenic route" was longer, and we stopped for an hour-long&nbsp;picnic lunch and <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225868567/in/set-72157634524364498">swim</A> at <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/9225861715/in/set-72157634524364498">beautiful Deception Lake</A>.&nbsp; We made it back to the trailhead around 3:30pm exhausted, stiffened, but fulfilled.&nbsp; Everyone agreed that it was an awesome adventure worth the effort and pain!&nbsp; Of course,&nbsp;the stop at <A href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/zekes-drive-in-gold-bar">Zeke's drive-in</A> on the way back home was the icing on the cake.</P><H3>Photos</H3><P><A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97139593@N03/sets/72157634524364498/">Here</A> is an online album of photos.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I didn't realize that a fingerprint had smudged the lens, so the quality of the images is less than desirable this time.</P><H3>GPS Info</H3>
