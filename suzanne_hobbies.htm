      <p><i>As a mother of two young children, I find that there is
little time
let for leisure.&nbsp; My hobbies can be broken down into three main
groups.&nbsp;
Books, Games, and Crafts.&nbsp; I am sure that as I go along my hobbies
will change as I do.</i> <br>

            <p>I have always loved to read.&nbsp; It is a love that I
learned from
my mother.&nbsp; I remember going to the library and seeing her check
out
a dozen books and going home and reading the first one completely that
night.&nbsp; We find reading to be almost as relaxing as sleep.&nbsp; I
have included a list of some of my favorite authors and I would
recommend
any one of their books.&nbsp; My favorite genre is mysteries, but just
about anything will work. </p>

            <p><img src="playstation2.jpg" align="left" height="200" width="230">I have always
loved to play games.&nbsp; I was never good at sports or arcade type
games,
but give me a thinking game and I'm happy.&nbsp; Luckily I am
married&nbsp;
to another game nut.&nbsp; We enjoy playing <a href="http://www.scrabble.com/">Scrabble</a>, <a href="http://www.cyberdarts.com/basics/dartsbasics.html">darts</a>,
and a new favorite...<a href="http://www.centralconnector.com/GAMES/mexicantrain.html">mexican
dominoes</a>.&nbsp; We even have computer programs to keep track of our
games so that we can track how we are doing.&nbsp; Another type of
games
we enjoy are computer games that are logic based.&nbsp; We recently
finished <a href="http://www.mystworlds.com/us/">Myst</a>
and are now working on the sequel <a href="http://www.riven.com/">Riven</a>.&nbsp;
For Christmas we were given a Playstation and as you can tell in the
picture,
I am hooked.&nbsp; I love that dragon called <a href="http://www.spyrothedragon.com/">Spyro</a>.&nbsp;
It is amazing that I get any thing done with all the toys I have to
play
with. </p>

            <p><img src="panda2.jpg" align="right" height="268" width="300">I am certainly
not your average craft person.&nbsp; I hate to have lots of little
knick-knacks
around because I don't want to have to dust them.&nbsp; However, there
are a few things I enjoy doing.&nbsp; I have cross-stitched eight
different
endangered animal babies to decorate the walls in the kid's room.&nbsp;
I have also done a few other pictures as gifts.&nbsp; In my earlier
days
I enjoyed painting with oils and hope to get back to it someday.&nbsp;
Thanks to my mother, I know how to sew, but I only do it under duress. </p>
