My first area outside of the city was San Nicolas.&nbsp; The apartment
here was a bit bigger, but there were anywhere from six to eight girls
living there at one time.&nbsp; With only one bathroom, it made it tough
to get everyone ready in the morning.&nbsp; In this area I rode a bike
for the first couple of weeks, until my poor companion crashed and broke
her foot.&nbsp; From then on it was buses for us.&nbsp; Riding a bike in
a skirt was a bit tricky.&nbsp; My poor skin blistered from sunburns, because
there is no shade on a bike.&nbsp; The countryside was beautiful.&nbsp;
It was at this time that I got to go to the temple in Buenos Aires pictured
here.&nbsp; My companions were Hna. Cortez of Cordoba, Arg., Hna. Trejo
of Tucuman, Arg., and Hna. Noguera of Misiones, Arg.&nbsp; I was there
for four months.

My last area was called Salto.&nbsp; I made a lot of good friends there.&nbsp;
The picture you see here is a memorial to one of Argentina's heroes, Pancho
Serra.&nbsp; These types of memorials are found all over Argentina.&nbsp;
The other photo shows you how humid it gets there.&nbsp; We cleaned the
mildew with water and bleach, but it didn't really help much.&nbsp; Quite
a different experience for a girl from dry central California.&nbsp; Other
unique experiences on the mission were washing clothes by hand, shopping
at several specialty stands instead of one supermarket, and not being able
to flush toilet paper.&nbsp; All of which really make you appreciate what
you have.&nbsp; I was there two months and had two companions in Salto.&nbsp;
Hna. Gonzalez of Mendoza, Arg. and Hna. Rivas of Rio Negro, Arg.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&nbsp; am very fortunate to have been able to go on a mission.&nbsp; It
is like packing a lifetime of experiences in 18 months.&nbsp; It really
changed me and made me the person I am today.
