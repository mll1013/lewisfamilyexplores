              of&nbsp;nine varsity scouts, and three adult leaders, the largest
              allowable&nbsp;group by national park regulations, since this is
              considered a backcountry lake.&nbsp; (The only road access is from
              a long dirt road on the Canadian side of the lake.)&nbsp; While
              distances varied, based on the actual route taken by each canoe,

            <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><u>Day 1</u>:&nbsp; We left church at
              5:00am and headed to the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/permits.htm">North
                Cascades National Park wilderness information center</a> in
              Marblemount to secure our campsites.&nbsp; While we didn't get our
              first choice of campgrounds for the first two days of the trip,
              the replacement campgrounds (McMillan and Ponderosa) were pretty
              nice camps as well.&nbsp; We <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinDgn">loaded
                the canoes</a> at the Colonial Creek boat launch and headed out
              onto glacial-fed <a title="https://flic.kr/p/ozQsNb" href="https://flic.kr/p/ozQsNb">Diablo
                Lake</a> with its turquoise-colored waters.&nbsp; Passing the <a
                href="https://flic.kr/p/oBBZwR">last rocky&nbsp;point of the
                lake</a>, we meandered up the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinF5H">Skagit
                River </a>en route to the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozEdyw">portage</a>
              up to Ross Lake.&nbsp; After putting in on Ross Lake, the Powells
              connected (<a href="https://flic.kr/p/oBC1wr">literally</a>) with
              Cody and Eric to make <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinH42">a very
                stable catamaran</a>.&nbsp; After enjoying the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinsDG">scenic
                mountain views</a> near the dam, we <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozSmUM">headed
                north</a> to our destination, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinPsU">McMillan

            <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><u>Day 2</u>:&nbsp; Enjoying near <a title="https://flic.kr/p/oinQbN"
                href="https://flic.kr/p/oinQbN">glass-like conditions</a>, we
              continued our journey up the lake.&nbsp; As temperatures rose, the
              guys found a <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozQwBJ">shady spot to
                cool off</a>... and decided to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinQS7">jump
                into the lake</a> from the East Bank Trail.&nbsp; After spotting
              one of the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozSptV">bridges along the
                trail</a>, we couldn't resist the opportunity to explore <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oxQxjm">Devil's
                Creek</a>, where the temperature was noticeably cooler in the <a
                href="https://flic.kr/p/oinwdA">narrow canyon</a>.&nbsp; After
              passing through a <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinwny">minor debris
                clog</a>, we quickly came to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozSqHi">the
                end of our journey</a> at some rapids. &nbsp; After some <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinhzd">great
                photo ops</a>, we <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinSD3">turned our
                canoes around</a>, and headed back out through <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinSL7">the
                narrow channel</a> back out <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oxQyoW">towards
                the lake</a> and on to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozQznU">Ponderosa
                Campground</a>. &nbsp; (<span style="color: #006600;">Start
                time: 10:27am, End Time: 2:30pm.</span>)</p>
            <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><u>Day 3</u>: Starting out with
              perfectly sunny skies and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinTVG">calm
                conditions</a>, we prepare ourselves for one of the longest
              paddle days of the trip.&nbsp; This was the only day we decided to
              stop for lunch along the way, and as soon as we rounded the point
              at Ponderosa we were able to make <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozQjK7">visual
                contact</a> with our picnic spot at Little Beaver
              Campground.&nbsp; The problem was that it made for some tedious
              paddling, since we were staring at the same spot for nearly two
              hours.&nbsp; Three of the canoes headed for the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oBC8b8">rocky
                shoreline</a> to explore something less monotonous.&nbsp;
              Rewarded with <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozSt4F">vistas of
                waterfalls</a>,&nbsp; they made it into the picnic area just <a
                href="https://flic.kr/p/oinNQx">about fifteen minutes later</a>
              than the first group.&nbsp; After lunch, a quick dip, and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozAD8B">some
                incredible views</a>, we <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinCt9">continued
                on our way</a> towards the north end of the lake near the
              Canadian border.&nbsp; The amenities at <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozQBDh">Silver
                Creek Campground</a> were the least convenient of the entire
              trip.&nbsp; Lacking the space to safely store all of our food and
              garbage, we decided to bear-proof the trash with a "<a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozStT6">garbage
                canoe</a>" that <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinVFA">Cody and
                Eric anchored off shore</a>.&nbsp; We gave Bro. Christie a
              priesthood blessing, since he had developed some tendonitis in his
              arm that threatened his ability to paddle back across the lake. (<span

            <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><u>Day 4</u>:&nbsp; Well, what do you
              know... it's <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozSuuX">another amazing
                day for paddling</a> on Lake Ross.&nbsp; Breaking out the
              hardware for <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozEmCh">the catamaran</a>,&nbsp;
              the Powells hooked up with Bro. Christie and Daniel this time, in
              case they needed any help paddling for the day.&nbsp; During a
              quick pit stop, we snapped a couple of photos of the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinQ8T">Little
                Beaver River</a> before heading on to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozAEDH">Arctic
                Canyon Falls</a> and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozAFtD">No Name
                Creek Falls</a>.&nbsp; With <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinvZt">Cat
                Island</a> in sight, we made a dash to our next
              campground.&nbsp; Since <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinYsh">the
                group campsite</a> was at the top of the island, it was a bit of
              a climb, but we enjoyed one of our longest afternoons there, where
              swimming, exploring, cliff jumping, deer-following, napping, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozSxjV">card-playing</a>
              and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinSDV">eating</a> (of course)
              were a few of the selected activities of the group. &nbsp;(<span style="color: #006600;">Start
                time: 8:40am, End Time: 11:50pm.</span>)</p>
            <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><u>Day 5</u>: After a <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozEpJh">hearty
                breakfast</a>, we packed up the canoes for our penultimate day
              of adventure.&nbsp; Once the group was <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oiorHZ">ready
                to launch</a>, we headed straight for <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozAspH">Lightening
                Creek</a>, where a few of the young men got their blood pumping
              from a <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinJcy">morning cliff jump</a>.
              After heading under the second <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinHW3">East
                Bank Trail bridge</a>, a couple of the canoes dashed across the
              lake to check out <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozArdz">Skymo Creek
                Falls</a> while others stopped off at Ponderosa for yet another
              cliff jump to cool off for the final stretch to our last campsite,
              Big Beaver Campground, where a threatening thunderstorm had
              everyone <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozEq6Q">scrambling for their
                rain flies</a>.&nbsp; When the lake grew too rough to swim in,
              the guys passed the time with a rousing game of <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinhaf">poker
                using Cheez-It</a>. (<span style="color: #006600;">Start time:
                8:30am, End Time: 12:41pm.</span>)</p>
            <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><u>Day 6</u>:&nbsp; After seeing the
              whitecaps on the lake during the threatening thunderstorm the
              night before, we were pleasantly surprised to see a sixth straight
              day of <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozEqU3">calm conditions</a>.&nbsp;
              Bro. Powell said, "If you would have told me before this trip that
              we'd have six days of glass on this lake, I wouldn't have believed
              it."&nbsp; It was apparent that everyone was eager to get home,
              because we busted a pace of 3.2MPH (we were consistently paddling
              between 2.4MPH and 2.6MPH for the other five days.)&nbsp; Hearing
              the cars on <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ozAJvv">Highway 20</a> for
              the first time in nearly a week made the end seem so much more
              real. As we left the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oinULa">Skagit
                River</a> onto <a href="https://flic.kr/p/oBCeGp">Diablo Lake</a>,
              it was a straight sprint to the end at the boat launch.&nbsp; On
              the way back home, we stopped at <a href="https://plus.google.com/103103660709288640531/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en">King
                Charley's</a> in Snohomish, for burgers, fries, and
              shakes.&nbsp; (<span style="color: #006600;">Start time: 9:01am,
                End Time: 1:14pm.</span>)</p>
            <h3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">I think I can speak for the whole group
              that the trip was a fun experience.&nbsp; We enjoyed the peace of
              a wilderness lake, even with the occasional motor boat passing
              by.&nbsp; At times, we could look for miles in every direction,
              and not spot anyone else in our entire field of view.&nbsp;
              Similar to last year's 50-mile hike to <a href="spider_gap.htm">Glacier
                Peak Wilderness</a>, the trip was not without incident.&nbsp;
              This year, Bro. Christie suffered from tendonitis that jeopardized
              his ability to paddle safely.&nbsp; Also like last year, a
              priesthood blessing was offered at the farthest distance into the
              trip.&nbsp; Some may consider it a coincidence that we had to call
              upon priesthood power 25 miles into both trips, but what better
              way for the Lord to call upon the faith of the young men and scout
              leaders alike to demonstrate his power in safely guiding the group
              back home.&nbsp; Bro. Christie expressed gratitude that he felt an
              increased amount of energy, and with his son, Eric, to help him
              paddle back to Colonial Creek, they often were the fastest boat,
              leading the group for much of the final 25 miles.&nbsp; The fact
              that a paddler with a swollen forearm could effectively do laps
              around the rest of us is compelling evidence of priesthood power.
